    <h1>THE OPENAL UTILITY TOOLKIT (ALUT).</h1>
    <h2>Reference Manual Version 1.0.0.</h2>
    <h2>First Release by Steve Baker - August 24th 2005.</h2>
    <h2>Second Release by Sven Panne - September 1st 2005.</h2>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>This is the first draft of the <a href="http://www.openal.org">OpenAL</a>
    Utility Toolkit (ALUT) Reference Manual.</p>

    <h2>Licensing</h2>

    <p>Some previous versions of ALUT were released under the BSD license -
    others under LGPL. This version will be released exclusively under LGPL.</p>

    <h2>Some History</h2>

    <p>At time of writing (August 2005), ALUT was a set of undocumented
    semi-portable functions that were mixed up in the OpenAL library
    distribution. The intent had always been that ALUT would be a cleanly
    separated library that would be portable between systems. It was hoped that
    it would be well suited to producing succinct demo programs and to help new
    developers to get started with OpenAL. It was to do this by removing the
    annoying details of getting an audio application started - allowing
    developers to learn OpenAL without distractions such as loading sound
    samples from disk.</p>

    <p>In order to move from this initial implementation to a clean API that
    would meet the original goals of ALUT, it was necessary to break from the
    past and make a clean start. The original version(s) were unnumbered - so we
    will arbitarily label all previous versions as 0.x.x and start this cleaned
    up version at release 1.0.0 to reflect changed API and implementations.</p>

    <h2>Backwards Compatibility with Version 0.x.x.</h2>

    <p>There are no formal guarantees of reverse compatibility with the various
    versions of ALUT prior to 1.0.0. Having said that, some effort has been made
    to at least allow these programs to continue to run if they are recompiled
    against ALUT 1.0.0 or later.</p>

    <h2>OpenGL, GLUT and using what you already know.</h2>

    <p>If you are already familiar with OpenGL and its utility toolkit 'GLUT',
    then you should feel very familiar with ALUT. Wherever GLUT has 'GL', ALUT
    has 'AL' and wherever GLUT has 'glut', ALUT has 'alut'. 'Window' is replaced
    with 'Context' throughout the API.</p>

    <p>Traditionally, here is 'Hello World' in ALUT - without error
    checking.</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;AL/alut.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  ALuint helloBuffer, helloSource;
  alutInit (&amp;argc, argv);
  helloBuffer = alutCreateBufferHelloWorld ();
  alGenSources (1, &amp;helloSource);
  alSourcei (helloSource, AL_BUFFER, helloBuffer);
  alSourcePlay (helloSource);
  sleep (3);
  alutExit ();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>

    <h2>Compiling and Linking</h2>

    <p>All ALUT programs should begin with:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;AL/alut.h&gt;
</pre>

    <p>(The ALUT header includes &lt;AL/al.h&gt; and &lt;AL/alc.h&gt; for you so
    you don't need to include them again - although it does not hurt to do
    so).</p>

    <p>Link with one of:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
libalut.so   -- Linux, BSD, UNIX, etc.
alut.dll     -- Windows.
???.???      -- MacOSX.
</pre>

    <p>Under UNIX/Linux/BSD systems, the ALUT header is conventionally stored in
    /usr/include/AL/alut.h and the library in /usr/lib/libalut.so. Place
    '-lalut' before '-lopenal' in your link command.</p>

    <p>Under Windows systems ????</p>

    <p>Under MacOSX systems ????</p>

    <h1>The ALUT API.</h1>

    <h2>Initialization / Exit</h2>

    <h3>alutInit</h3>

    <p>The first call to ALUT must always be one of the following:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALboolean alutInit (int *argcp, char **argv);

ALboolean alutInitWithoutContext (int *argcp, char **argv);
</pre>

    <p>Both calls initialise the ALUT internals - alutInit() also creates a
    single OpenAL 'context' on the default device. If you don't know what an
    OpenAL context is - use alutInit and be happy!</p>

    <p>If you want something more complex than that (eg running on a non-default
    device - or opening multiple contexts on multiple devices) then you should
    call alutInitWithoutContext instead of alutInit. Then you may use OpenAL's
    ALC API to create your own context(s) on whatever devices you prefer.</p>

    <p>Both functions return AL_TRUE on success of AL_FALSE if there was a
    problem.</p>

    <p>If you pass alutInit/alInitWithoutContext the argc and argv from your
    main program, it may examine your command-line options and may use (and
    remove) those options that it recognises.</p>

    <p>e.g.</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  alutInit (&amp;argc, argv);
</pre>

    <p>Precisely which (if any) command-line options are accepted - and what
    they control is implementation and operating system dependent. Notably; some
    implementations will use argv[0] in debug and error messages - but this is
    not guaranteed by the API because it is operating-system dependent. On some
    OS's, alutInit may garner initial settings from other sources such as
    'registry' data, '.alutrc' files or shell variables. Please consult the
    README.xxx file for your OS if you need further details.</p>

    <p>It is acceptable to call alutInit(NULL,NULL) in settings where no useful
    information can be obtained from argc and argv.</p>

    <h3>alutExit</h3>

    <p>When the application has finished playing audio, it should shut down ALUT
    in order to destroy the audio context it created with alutInit:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
void alutExit ();
</pre>

    <p>This closes any OpenAL device/context that ALUT may have created in
    alutInit (but not any that the application created using ALC). After calling
    alutExit, you may subsequently call alutInit or alutInitWithoutContext again
    if you so desire.</p>

    <h3>NOTES</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><i>It is an error to make more than one call to alutInit without first
      calling alutExit. If you need more complex device/context support, please
      use the OpenAL 'ALC' API.</i></li>

      <li><i>Under well-behaved operating systems, it should be acceptable to
      simply exit from your program without bothering to call alutExit - relying
      on the OS to clean up after you. However, it is dangerous to rely on this
      behavior if portable operation is expected.</i></li>

      <li><i>Some ALUT implementations may allow you to create a context on a
      non-default OpenAL device using alutInit by telling ALUT which device to
      use with a flag on the command line, a Shell Variable, the '.alutrc' file
      or a 'registry' entry. But this behavior is not guaranteed. By default,
      you'll get whatever device is the ALC default.</i></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Error Handling</h2>

    <h3>alutGetError and alutGetErrorString</h3>

    <p>Any ALUT routine that has an error return will set a global error code
    that may be retrieved with:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALenum alutGetError ();
</pre>

    <p>A number of tokens named ALUT_ERROR_xxxxx are defined in alut.h, the list
    is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_NO_ERROR -- The default return if no error was logged.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY -- Set by any function.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_INVALID_ENUM -- Set by any function.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE -- Set by any function.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION -- Set by any function.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_NOT_INITIALISED -- Set by any function if alutInit/alutInitWithoutContext has not yet been called.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_NO_DEVICE_AVAILABLE -- Set by alutInit.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_NO_CONTEXT_AVAILABLE -- Set by alutInit.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND -- Set by all file loaders.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_FILE_NOT_READABLE -- Set by all file loaders.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE -- Set by all file loaders.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_SUBTYPE -- Set by all file loaders.</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_CORRUPT_OR_TRUNCATED_FILE -- Set by all file loaders.</li>
      <li>...others to be decided as initial implementation proceeds... </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Error codes are not cleared by successful ALUT calls and if an error
    condition occurs, is stored and a subsequent error comes along, the second
    error will simply be ignored. Calling alutGetError will reset the error code
    to ALUT_ERROR_NO_ERROR.</p>

    <p>There is a second routine:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
const char *alutGetErrorString (ALenum error);
</pre>

    <p>...which converts an error code into a human-readable description. The
    precise text of the strings that are returned may vary from implementation
    to implementation and should not be relied upon by the application.</p>

    <h2>Example of Context Handling and Error Reporting</h2>

    <p>A typical ALUT program will look like this:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  if (!alutInit (&amp;argc, argv))
    {
      ALenum error = alutGetError ();
      fprintf (stderr, "%s: %s\n", argv[0], alutGetErrorString (error));
      exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

  /* ...play audio for a while... */

  alutExit ();
  exit (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
</pre>

    <h2>Sound Sample File Loading</h2>

    <p>ALUT attempts to simplify the business of getting a simple application
    running by providing loaders for a range of file formats.</p>

    <h3>alutCreateBufferFromFile / alutCreateBufferFromFileImage</h3>

    <p>Rather than enumerate a list of formats that will likely grow with time,
    there is a single entrypoint for loading files of all formats:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALuint alutCreateBufferFromFile (const char *filename);

ALuint alutCreateBufferFromFileImage (const ALvoid *data, ALsizei length);
</pre>

    <p>alutCreateBufferFromFile opens the specified filename, reads enough of
    the header to determine whether the file is one of the types that ALUT
    recognises. If so then the file is read and placed into an alBuffer whose
    handle is returned as the result. alutCreateBufferFromFileImage does the
    same thing for a file image which has been placed into a block of memory
    whose length is given in the 'length' parameter.</p>

    <p>Both routines return zero in the event of an error - with alutGetError
    providing more detail if required.</p>

    <h3>alutLoadMemoryFromFile / alutLoadMemoryFromFileImage</h3>

    <p>For applications that require a more hands-on approach,</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALvoid *alutLoadMemoryFromFile (const char *filename,
                                ALenum *format,
                                ALsizei *size,
                                ALuint *freq);

ALvoid *alutLoadMemoryFromFileImage (const ALvoid *data,
                                     ALsizei length,
                                     ALenum *format,
                                     ALsizei *size,
                                     ALuint *freq);
</pre>

    <p>These routines load data from disk or memory as with the
    alutCreateBuffer* versions - but allocate a block of RAM to store it in -
    leaving it up to the application to make alBufferData calls to pass it on to
    OpenAL and to free() the memory after use.</p>

    <p>Additionally, if any of the format, size, freq or loop parameters are
    non-NULL, they will be populated with the format of the file (one of the
    standard AL_ tokens will be returned - suitable for passing into
    alBufferData), the size or the block in bytes and the frequency in Hertz at
    which the sample was recorded. The returned result will be the address of
    the data in memory or NULL in the event of an error. alutGetError will (as
    usual) provide more details.</p>

    <h3>alutEnumerateSupportedFileTypes</h3>

    <p>You can obtain a comma-separated list of supported filename extensions
    (suitable for passing to a directory browser popup) using:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
const char *alutEnumerateSupportedFileTypes ();
</pre>

    <p>This will return something like "*.wav, *.ogg, *.au".</p>

    <h3>NOTES</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><i> It is possible that for some file types (notably '.wav') the
      support may be only for a few sub-formats. For example, an implementation
      may advertise that "*.wav" is supported when in fact it only supports
      uncompressed WAV files and not the compressed variety. In this event, the
      various ALUT file loaders may return an error and set
      ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_SUBTYPE rather than
      ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE which would indicate that no files of
      this type are allowed.</i></li>

      <li><i> It is possible that alutLoadMemoryFromFile will be unable to
      support some file types that alutCreateBufferFromFile can support
      (although the reverse is never the case). In this situation, that file
      type WILL be listed in alutEnumerateSupportedFileTypes - but the actual
      call to alutLoadMemoryFromFile will fail - returning
      ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE.</i></li>

      <li><i>For reverse-compatibility with ALUT 0.x.x, there are three
      deprecated functions:</i></li>
    </ol>

<pre class="programlisting">
void alutLoadWAVFile (ALbyte *filename,
                      ALenum *format,
                      void **data,
                      ALsizei *size,
                      ALsizei *freq,
                      ALboolean *loop);

void alutLoadWAVMemory (ALbyte *buffer,
                        ALenum *format,
                        void **data,
                        ALsizei *size,
                        ALsizei *freq,
                        ALboolean *loop);

void alutUnloadWAV (ALenum format ALvoid *data, ALsizei size, ALsizei freq);
</pre>


    <p><i>On the MacOS 0.x.x version, the 'loop' parameter is omitted from both
    alutLoadWAV* functions.</i></p>

    <h2>Built-in Sounds</h2>

    <p>In order to simplify initial startup - and to keep test program
    distributions clean, ALUT provides built-in sounds that do not require disk
    I/O because they are built into the ALUT library:</p>

    <h3>alutCreateBufferHelloWorld / alutCreateBufferWaveform</h3>

    <p>The following functions return an alBuffer handle:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALuint alutCreateBufferHelloWorld ();

ALuint alutCreateBufferWaveform   (ALenum waveshape,
                                   float frequency,
                                   float phase,
                                   float duration);
</pre>

    <p>alutCreateBufferHelloWorld returns the handle of an alBuffer containing
    the sound of someone saying "Hello World".</p>

    <p>The alutCreateBufferWaveform returns a snippet of audio with the
    specified waveshape (ALUT_WAVEFORM_SINE, ALUT_WAVEFORM_SQUARE,
    ALUT_WAVEFORM_SAWTOOTH, ALUT_WAVEFORM_WHITENOISE or ALUT_WAVEFORM_IMPULSE)
    and at the specified frequency (in Hertz), phase (in degrees: -180 to +180)
    and duration (in seconds). The duration will always be rounded up to an
    exact number of cycles of the sound to avoid a click if you loop the
    sample. The frequency and phase terms are ignored for ALUT_WHITENOISE.</p>

    <p>These functions may be used to write compact ALUT test/example
    applications with no external file dependancies whatever. When sending short
    application programs to either the ALUT or OpenAL developers as a part of
    bug reporting, one should endeavor to use these functions instead of loading
    ones own sound files.</p>

    <p>Each routine returns the handle of a newly allocated alBuffer - or zero
    if there was some problem in generating it.</p>

    <h2>Version Checking.</h2>

    <h3>alutGetMajorVersion / alutGetMinorVersion</h3>

    <p>In version 1.0.0 and later, alut.h header file contains:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
#define ALUT_API_MAJOR_VERSION 1

#define ALUT_API_MINOR_VERSION 0
</pre>

    <p>(These will be incremented appropriately in future revisions of
    ALUT).</p>

    <p>The ALUT library contains:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALint alutGetMajorVersion ();

ALint alutGetMinorVersion ();
</pre>

    <p>If the ALUT API gets added to or changed in future releases, we will
    increment that number to match the major and minor version numbers of this
    ALUT specification document. Applications can verify at runtime that they
    have been compiled and linked with the matching header file and library
    file.</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
#ifdef ALUT_API_MAJOR_VERSION
if (alutGetMajorVersion () != ALUT_API_MAJOR_VERSION ||
    alutGetMinorVersion () != ALUT_API_MINOR_VERSION)
  /* Oh-oh!  The ALUT header and the ALUT library are different revisions... */
#else
  /* Oh-oh!  We're linking against an ALUT 0.x.x header file... */
#endif
</pre>

    <p>The third part of the ALUT version number is incremented only when fixing
    minor bugs and is not accessible via this mechanism.</p>
