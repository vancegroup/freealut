    <h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

    <p>This is a draft of the <a href="http://www.openal.org/">OpenAL</a>
    Utility Toolkit (ALUT) Reference Manual.</p>

    <h2><a name="Licensing"></a>Licensing</h2>

    <p>Some previous versions of ALUT were released under the BSD license -
    others under LGPL. This version will be released exclusively under LGPL.</p>

    <h2><a name="History"></a>Some History</h2>

    <p>At time of writing (August 2005), ALUT was a set of undocumented
    semi-portable functions that were mixed up in the OpenAL library
    distribution. The intent had always been that ALUT would be a cleanly
    separated library that would be portable between systems. It was hoped that
    it would be well suited to producing succinct demo programs and to help new
    developers to get started with OpenAL. It was to do this by removing the
    annoying details of getting an audio application started - allowing
    developers to learn OpenAL without distractions such as loading sound
    samples from disk.</p>

    <p>In order to move from this initial implementation to a clean API that
    would meet the original goals of ALUT, it was necessary to break from the
    past and make a clean start. The original version(s) were unnumbered - so we
    will arbitarily label all previous versions as 0.x.x and start this cleaned
    up version at release 1.0.0 to reflect changed API and implementations.</p>

    <h2><a name="BackwardsCompatibility"></a>Backwards Compatibility with Version 0.x.x</h2>

    <p>There are no formal guarantees of reverse compatibility with the various
    versions of ALUT prior to 1.0.0. Having said that, some effort has been made
    to at least allow these programs to continue to run if they are recompiled
    against ALUT 1.0.0 or later.</p>

    <h2><a name="OpenGLGLUT"></a>OpenGL, GLUT and using what you already know</h2>

    <p>If you are already familiar with OpenGL and its utility toolkit 'GLUT',
    then you should feel very familiar with ALUT. Wherever GLUT has 'GL', ALUT
    has 'AL' and wherever GLUT has 'glut', ALUT has 'alut'. 'Window' is replaced
    with 'Context' throughout the API.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <h4>Example: 'Hello, world' in ALUT</h4>

      <p>Here is the traditional first program for any language or library, but
      this time it is actually <em>saying</em> 'Hello, world!' instead of
      printing it:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;AL/alut.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  ALuint helloBuffer, helloSource;
  alutInit (&amp;argc, argv);
  helloBuffer = alutCreateBufferHelloWorld ();
  alGenSources (1, &amp;helloSource);
  alSourcei (helloSource, AL_BUFFER, helloBuffer);
  alSourcePlay (helloSource);
  alutMicroSleep (3000000);
  alutExit ();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>

      <p>Note that there error checks are missing in the program above to keep
      it simple.</p>

    </div>

    <h3><a name="CompilingLinking"></a>Compiling and Linking</h3>

    <p>All ALUT programs should contain:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
#include &lt;AL/alut.h&gt;
</pre>

    <p>The ALUT header includes &lt;AL/al.h&gt; and &lt;AL/alc.h&gt; for you so
    you don't need to include them again - although it does not hurt to do
    so. ALUT reserves the &quot;ALUT_&quot; prefix for preprocessor macros, so
    you should never define such a macro in your own program. Furthermore, you
    should not rely on any macro starting with &quot;ALUT_&quot; not mentioned
    in this specification.</p>

    <p>To find out the necessary compilation flags, use one of the following
    commands:</p>

<pre class="screen">
pkg-config --cflags openal
openal-config --cflags
</pre>

    <p>To find out the necessary flags for linking, use one of the following
    commands:</p>

<pre class="screen">
pkg-config --libs openal
openal-config --libs
</pre>

    <p>On Windows, link with alut.dll and openal32.dll</p>

    <p>ALUT reserves the &quot;alut&quot; prefix for globally visible functions
    and variables, so you should never define such a function or variable in
    your own program. Furthermore, you should not rely on any such function or
    variable not mentioned in this specification.</p>

    <h1><a name="API"></a>The ALUT API</h1>

    <h2><a name="ErrorHandling"></a>Error Handling</h2>

    <p>ALUT's error handling and reporting is a little bit different from the
    one used in OpenAL and OpenGL: All functions which can fail report
    success/failure via a return value, where AL_FALSE/AL_NONE/NULL mean
    failure. alutGetError can be used to find out what exactly went wrong.</p>

    <p>ALUT starts in an <em>uninitialized</em> state. alutInit and
    alutInitWithoutContext put ALUT into the <em>initialized</em> state. Those
    functions must only be called when the state is <em>uninitialized</em>.
    alutExit puts ALUT back from an <em>initialized</em> state to an
    <em>uninitialized</em> one.</p>

    <p>The following functions must only be called in an <em>initialized</em>
    state and with a current context: alutExit, alutCreateBufferFromFile,
    alutCreateBufferFromFileImage, alutLoadMemoryFromFile,
    alutLoadMemoryFromFileImage, alutEnumerateSupportedFileTypes,
    alutCreateBufferHelloWorld, alutCreateBufferWaveform. All these functions
    check for AL/ALC errors on entry and immediately return
    ALUT_ERROR_AL_ERROR_ON_ENTRY or ALUT_ERROR_ALC_ERROR_ON_ENTRY if there was
    one.</p>

    <p>The following functions never fail and can be called in any state:
    alutGetError, alutGetErrorString, alutGetMajorVersion,
    alutGetMinorVersion.</p>

    <p>alutMicroSleep can be called in every state.</p>

    <p>It is guaranteed that if a function fails, no data pointed to by pointer
    arguments has been changed.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutGetError"></a>alutGetError</h3>

    <p>Any ALUT routine that has an error return will set a global error code
    that may be retrieved with:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALenum alutGetError (void);
</pre>

    <p>A number of tokens named ALUT_ERROR_xxxxx are defined in alut.h, the list
    is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_NO_ERROR: No ALUT error found</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY: ALUT ran out of memory</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_INVALID_ENUM: ALUT was given an invalid enumeration token</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE: ALUT was given an invalid value</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION: ALUT was asked to do an invalid operation</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_NOT_INITIALISED: ALUT has not been initialised</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_NO_CURRENT_CONTEXT: There is no current AL context</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_AL_ERROR_ON_ENTRY: There was already an AL error on entry to an ALUT function</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_ALC_ERROR_ON_ENTRY: There was already an ALC error on entry to an ALUT function</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_OPEN_DEVICE: There was an error opening the ALC device</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_CLOSE_DEVICE: There was an error closing the ALC device</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_CREATE_CONTEXT: There was an error creating an ALC context</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_MAKE_CONTEXT_CURRENT: Could not change the current ALC context</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_DESTROY_CONTEXT: There was an error destroying the ALC context</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND: File not found</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_FILE_NOT_READABLE: File found but not readable</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE: Unsupported file type</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_SUBTYPE: Unsupported mode within an otherwise usable file type</li>
      <li>ALUT_ERROR_CORRUPT_OR_TRUNCATED_FILE: File was corrupt or truncated</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If an error condition occurs, it is stored internally. If a subsequent
    error occurs while there is still an error recorded internally, the second
    error will simply be ignored. Calling alutGetError will reset the error code
    to ALUT_ERROR_NO_ERROR. Error codes are not cleared by successful ALUT
    calls.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutGetErrorString"></a>alutGetErrorString</h3>

<pre class="programlisting">
const char *alutGetErrorString (ALenum error);
</pre>

    <p>alutGetErrorString can be used to convert an error code into a
    human-readable description. The precise text of these descriptions may vary
    from implementation to implementation and should not be relied upon by the
    application. An unknown error code is not considered an error and a generic
    description is returned in that case.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <h4>Example: Context Handling and Error Reporting</h4>

      <p>A typical ALUT program will look like this:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  if (!alutInit (&amp;argc, argv))
    {
      ALenum error = alutGetError ();
      fprintf (stderr, "%s: %s\n", argv[0], alutGetErrorString (error));
      exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

  /* ...play audio for a while... */

  alutExit ();
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
</pre>
    </div>

    <h2><a name="InitializationExit"></a>Initialization / Exit</h2>

    <h3><a name="alutInit"></a>alutInit</h3>

    <p>The first call to ALUT must always be one of the following:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALboolean alutInit (int *argcp, char **argv);

ALboolean alutInitWithoutContext (int *argcp, char **argv);
</pre>

    <p>Both calls initialise the ALUT internals - alutInit() also creates a
    single OpenAL 'context' on the default device. If you don't know what an
    OpenAL context is - use alutInit and be happy!</p>

    <p>If you want something more complex than that (eg running on a non-default
    device - or opening multiple contexts on multiple devices) then you should
    call alutInitWithoutContext instead of alutInit. Then you may use OpenAL's
    ALC API to create your own context(s) on whatever devices you prefer.</p>

    <p>Both functions return AL_TRUE on success or AL_FALSE if there was a
    problem.</p>

    <div class="example">

      <h4>Example: Handling command-line options</h4>

      <p>If you pass alutInit/alInitWithoutContext the argc and argv from your
      main program, it will examine your command-line options and use (and
      remove) those options that it recognises:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
int
main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  alutInit (&amp;argc, argv);
  ...
}
</pre>

    </div>

    <p>Precisely which (if any) command-line options are accepted - and what
    they control is implementation and operating system dependent. Notably; some
    implementations will use argv[0] in debug and error messages - but this is
    not guaranteed by the API because it is operating-system dependent. On some
    OS's, alutInit may garner initial settings from other sources such as
    'registry' data, '.alutrc' files or shell variables. Please consult the
    README.xxx file for your OS if you need further details.</p>

    <p>It is acceptable to call alutInit(NULL,NULL) in settings where no useful
    information can be obtained from argc and argv.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutExit"></a>alutExit</h3>

    <p>When the application has finished playing audio, it should shut down ALUT
    in order to destroy the audio context it created with alutInit:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALboolean alutExit (void);
</pre>

    <p>This closes any OpenAL device/context that ALUT may have created in
    alutInit (but not any that the application created using ALC). After calling
    alutExit, you may subsequently call alutInit or alutInitWithoutContext again
    if you so desire. alutExit returns AL_TRUE on success and AL_FALSE on failure.</p>

    <h3><a name="InitializationExitNotes"></a>Notes</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>It is an error to make more than one call to alutInit without first
      calling alutExit. If you need more complex device/context support, please
      use the OpenAL 'ALC' API.</li>

      <li>Under well-behaved operating systems, it should be acceptable to
      simply exit from your program without bothering to call alutExit - relying
      on the OS to clean up after you. However, it is dangerous to rely on this
      behavior if portable operation is expected.</li>

      <li>Some ALUT implementations may allow you to create a context on a
      non-default OpenAL device using alutInit by telling ALUT which device to
      use with a flag on the command line, a Shell Variable, the '.alutrc' file
      or a 'registry' entry. But this behavior is not guaranteed. By default,
      you'll get whatever device is the ALC default.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="Loading"></a>Sound Sample File Loading</h2>

    <p>ALUT attempts to simplify the business of getting a simple application
    running by providing loaders for a range of file formats.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutCreateBufferFromFoo"></a>alutCreateBufferFromFile / alutCreateBufferFromFileImage</h3>

    <p>Rather than enumerate a list of formats that will likely grow with time,
    there is a single entrypoint for loading files of all formats:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALuint alutCreateBufferFromFile (const char *filename);

ALuint alutCreateBufferFromFileImage (const ALvoid *data, ALsizei length);
</pre>

    <p>alutCreateBufferFromFile opens the specified filename, reads enough of
    the header to determine whether the file is one of the types that ALUT
    recognises. If so then the file is read and placed into an alBuffer whose
    handle is returned as the result. alutCreateBufferFromFileImage does the
    same thing for a file image which has been placed into a block of memory
    whose length is given in the 'length' parameter.</p>

    <p>Both routines return AL_NONE in the event of an error - with alutGetError
    providing more detail if required.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutLoadMemoryFromFoo"></a>alutLoadMemoryFromFile / alutLoadMemoryFromFileImage</h3>

    <p>For applications that require a more hands-on approach,</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALvoid *alutLoadMemoryFromFile (const char *filename,
                                ALenum *format,
                                ALsizei *size,
                                ALfloat *freq);

ALvoid *alutLoadMemoryFromFileImage (const ALvoid *data,
                                     ALsizei length,
                                     ALenum *format,
                                     ALsizei *size,
                                     ALfloat *freq);
</pre>

    <p>These routines load data from disk or memory as with the
    alutCreateBuffer* versions - but allocate a block of RAM to store it in -
    leaving it up to the application to make alBufferData calls to pass it on to
    OpenAL and to free() the memory after use.</p>

    <p>Additionally, if any of the format, size, freq or loop parameters are
    non-NULL, they will be populated with the format of the file (one of the
    standard AL_ tokens will be returned - suitable for passing into
    alBufferData), the size or the block in bytes and the frequency in Hertz at
    which the sample was recorded. The returned result will be the address of
    the data in memory or NULL in the event of an error. alutGetError will (as
    usual) provide more details.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutEnumerateSupportedFileTypes"></a>alutEnumerateSupportedFileTypes</h3>

<pre class="programlisting">
const char *alutEnumerateSupportedFileTypes (void);
</pre>

    <p>alutEnumerateSupportedFileTypes returns a comma-separated list of
    supported filename extensions, suitable for passing to a directory browser
    popup, e.g. something like &quot;*.wav, *.ogg, *.au&quot;.</p>

    <h3><a name="LoadingNotes"></a>Notes</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>It is possible that for some file types (notably '.wav') the support
      may be only for a few sub-formats. For example, an implementation may
      advertise that "*.wav" is supported when in fact it only supports
      uncompressed WAV files and not the compressed variety. In this event, the
      various ALUT file loaders may return an error and set
      ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_SUBTYPE rather than
      ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE which would indicate that no files of
      this type are allowed.</li>

      <li>It is possible that alutLoadMemoryFromFile will be unable to support
      some file types that alutCreateBufferFromFile can support (although the
      reverse is never the case). In this situation, that file type WILL be
      listed in alutEnumerateSupportedFileTypes - but the actual call to
      alutLoadMemoryFromFile will fail - returning
      ALUT_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE.</li>

      <li>For backwards-compatibility with ALUT 0.x.x, ALUT still offers the
      three deprecated functions below. Note that on MacOS 0.x.x version, the
      'loop' parameter is omitted from both alutLoadWAV* functions.</li>
    </ol>

<pre class="programlisting">
void alutLoadWAVFile (ALbyte *filename,
                      ALenum *format,
                      void **data,
                      ALsizei *size,
                      ALsizei *freq,
                      ALboolean *loop);

void alutLoadWAVMemory (ALbyte *buffer,
                        ALenum *format,
                        void **data,
                        ALsizei *size,
                        ALsizei *freq,
                        ALboolean *loop);

void alutUnloadWAV (ALenum format ALvoid *data, ALsizei size, ALsizei freq);
</pre>

    <h2><a name="BuiltinSounds"></a>Built-in Sounds</h2>

    <p>In order to simplify initial startup - and to keep test program
    distributions clean, ALUT provides built-in sounds that do not require disk
    I/O because they are built into the ALUT library. These functions may be
    used to write compact ALUT test/example applications with no external file
    dependancies whatsoever. When sending short application programs to either
    the ALUT or OpenAL developers as a part of bug reporting, one should
    endeavor to use these functions instead of loading ones own sound files.</p>

    <p>Each routine returns the handle of a newly allocated OpenAL buffer - or
    AL_NONE if there was some problem in generating it.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutCreateBufferHelloWorld"></a>alutCreateBufferHelloWorld</h3>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALuint alutCreateBufferHelloWorld (void);
</pre>

    <p>alutCreateBufferHelloWorld returns the handle of an OpenAL buffer

    on failure.</p>

                                   ALfloat duration);
</pre>

    <p>alutCreateBufferWaveform returns a handle of an OpenAL buffer containing
    a snippet of audio with the specified waveshape (ALUT_WAVEFORM_SINE,
    ALUT_WAVEFORM_SQUARE, ALUT_WAVEFORM_SAWTOOTH, ALUT_WAVEFORM_WHITENOISE or
    ALUT_WAVEFORM_IMPULSE) and at the specified frequency (in Hertz), phase (in
    degrees: -180 to +180) and duration (in seconds). The duration will always
    be rounded up to an exact number of cycles of the sound to avoid a click if
    you loop the sample. The frequency and phase arguments are ignored for
    ALUT_WHITENOISE. alutCreateBufferWaveform returns AL_NONE on failure.</p>

    <h2><a name="VersionChecking"></a>Version Checking</h2>

    <p>ALUT version numbers consist of a major version number, a minor version
    number, and a patchlevel. The former two numbers will match the major/minor
    version number of the corresponding ALUT specification document and can be
    accessed at compile time as well as runtime. The patchlevel is not
    programmatically available and it is incremented only when fixing bugs
    without any API changes.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutGetMajorVersion"></a>alutGetMajorVersion</h3>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALint alutGetMajorVersion (void);
</pre>

    <p>alutGetMajorVersion returns the major version numbers of the ALUT in
    use. This function never fails and no AL/ALC/ALUT error state is
    affected.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutGetMinorVersion"></a>alutGetMinorVersion</h3>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALint alutGetMinorVersion (void);
</pre>

    <p>alutGetMinorVersion returns the minor version numbers of the ALUT in
    use. This function never fails and no AL/ALC/ALUT error state is
    affected.</p>

    <h3><a name="VersioningMacros"></a>Compile Time Version Checking</h3>

<pre class="programlisting">
#define ALUT_API_MAJOR_VERSION 1

#define ALUT_API_MINOR_VERSION 0
</pre>

    <p>In version 1.0.0 and later, the alut.h header file contains the above
    macro definitions, whose values will be incremented appropriately in future
    revisions of ALUT.</p>


    <div class="example">
      <h4>Example: Version consistency check</h4>

      <p>Applications can verify at runtime that they have been compiled and
      linked with the matching header file and library file as follows:</p>

<pre class="programlisting">
#ifdef ALUT_API_MAJOR_VERSION
if (alutGetMajorVersion () != ALUT_API_MAJOR_VERSION ||
    alutGetMinorVersion () != ALUT_API_MINOR_VERSION)
  /* Oh-oh!  The ALUT header and the ALUT library are different revisions... */
#else
  /* Oh-oh!  We're linking against an ALUT 0.x.x header file... */
#endif
</pre>
    </div>

    <h2><a name="Sleeping"></a>Sleeping</h2>

    <p>Having a general utility function like the following in an audio-related
    toolkit might seem strange at first, but sleeping is a common task in a lot
    of audio demos and it can't be done portably without cluttering the source
    code with #ifdefs.</p>

    <h3><a name="alutMicroSleep"></a>alutMicroSleep</h3>

<pre class="programlisting">
ALboolean alutMicroSleep (ALuint microSeconds);
</pre>

    <p>alutMicroSleep will delay the execution of the current thread for at
    least the given amount of microseconds. It will only return earlier if a
    signal has been delivered to the thread, but this does not count as an
    error. alutMicroSleep returns AL_TRUE on success and AL_FALSE on failure.
    Note that sleeping for 0 microseconds will give other runnable threads a
    chance to run.</p>
